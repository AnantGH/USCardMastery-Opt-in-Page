## Application Overview

This is a Next.js application designed to serve as a marketing funnel.

## Pages

- **Home Page (`/`)**: The main landing page of the application. This page now displays the content copied from `https://go.usmarketmastery.com/free-guide-access`. The data fetching for the home page is handled server-side using `getServerSideProps` to address a CORS issue. The `/pages/index.tsx` file was deleted and recreated with clean code to resolve persistent parsing errors.
- **New Page (`/free-guide-access`)**: This page was initially created but its content was moved to the home page (`/`) to address a CORS issue. The data fetching for the home page is now handled server-side using `getServerSideProps`. The `pages/index.tsx` file was also sanitized to remove hidden characters and fix a parsing error.

## Components 

- **(To be determined)**: As the application is developed, specific reusable components will be identified and listed here.

## Data Fetching and Flow

- User interacts with the application through the web pages.
- (Further data flow details will be added as the application becomes more complex, e.g., form submissions, API calls, etc.)

## Styling

- Global styles are managed in `styles/globals.css`.
- Module-specific styles will be created as needed (e.g., `components/ComponentName.module.css`).
- The new page (`/free-guide-access`) will incorporate the styling from the copied URL.

## Accessibility

- All pages and components will be developed with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines. This includes semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where necessary, and keyboard navigation support.

## Responsiveness

- The application is designed to be fully responsive and work on various devices and screen sizes. CSS media queries and flexible layouts will be used. The new page (`/free-guide-access`) is explicitly designed to be mobile responsive based on the source content.

## Future Enhancements
